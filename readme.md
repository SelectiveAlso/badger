'A core principle of Agile and Lean theory is that software
development projects should seek to maximize business
value. Projects should be judged not on their adherence to
cost and schedule milestones, but on their delivery of value to the
enterprise. Value should be delivered as quickly as possible—in small
increments—and features should be prioritized based on the amount
of value they deliver. DevOps, in a sense, is about setting up a value
delivery factory—a streamlined, waste-free pipeline through which
value can be delivered to the business with a predictably fast cycle
time. Rapid feedback from production to development then allows
us to optimize that value delivery machine.'
